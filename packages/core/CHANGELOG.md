# @pattern-algebra/core

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7cd829e: ## New Features

  ### Pattern Algebra Operations
  - Added `patternIntersect()`, `patternUnion()`, `patternComplement()`, and `patternDifference()` for set operations on compiled patterns
  - Patterns can now be combined using standard set algebra

  ### Automaton Improvements
  - Added DFA size limits to prevent exponential state blowup during determinization
  - `determinize()` now accepts `DeterminizeOptions` with configurable `maxStates` (default: 10,000)
  - Added `AutomatonLimitError` for handling state limit exceeded conditions
  - Added `SegmentMatcher` interface for composite pattern matching without faking RegExp

  ### Path Utilities
  - Added `PathContext` interface for path resolution operations
  - Updated `normalizePath()` to properly handle `~`, relative paths, and project roots

  ## Bug Fixes
  - Fixed `createIntersectionPattern` to use proper `SegmentMatcher` instead of fake RegExp object with invalid properties

  ## Documentation
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to all interface properties in type definitions
  - Documented `PathContext` usage in README
  - Added examples for pattern algebra operations

  ## Tests
  - Added 38 new tests for automaton operations:
    - 14 tests for `determinize()` including state limit handling
    - 15 tests for `isEmpty()`, `findWitness()`, and `countPaths()`
    - 9 tests for `complement()` operation
